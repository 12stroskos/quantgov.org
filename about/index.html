  <p>What is QuantGov?</p>
  
  <p>QuantGov is an effort to expand the frontiers of economic and legal 
    research by providing an open-source framework to uncover the latent data in 
    almost any text. QuantGov is able to complete this nearly impossible task by 
    using a machine learning algorithm that consists of a corpus, an estimator, 
    and a project (which can be downloaded in the platform section of this website). 
    A machine learning algorithm teaches a program how to complete a task via training, 
    compared to copious amounts of computer code.</p>
  
  <p>History of QuantGov</p>

  <p>QuantGov grew out of the RegData project that was originally released in 2012, 
    and has since been updated an additional three times. RegData looked improve the 
    measurement of regulations and the regulatory process, by quantifying the amount of 
    regulations in a consistent and reliable way. RegData completed this task by using 
    an older version of the same machine learning algorithm to count the amount of regulations 
    in the Federal Register, relating the results to the North American Industry 
    Classification System so that regulations per industry could be quantified. 
    The progression from RegData to QuantGov reflects two realizations: first, that the 
    kinds of tools used in RegData can be useful in other contexts, and second, that a clear 
    framework could ease adoption of these methods and allow researchers to build off of one 
    another's work without constant reinvention of the wheel.</p>
  
  <p>Future of QuantGov</p>
  
  <p>The future of QuantGov yields almost infinite opportunities. By open-sourcing the 
    machine learning algorithm that drives both RegData and QuantGov, the hope is that 
    private research in the regulations sector will explode exponentially. On top of this, 
    the algorithm can be applied to almost any printed document, which allows for research 
    expansion in sectors even outside of regulation. In summary, the future of QuantGov will 
    be determined by you. What new and innovative way will you come up with to use QuantGov?</p>
