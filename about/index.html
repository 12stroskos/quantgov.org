<section id="about-text">
  <p>QuantGov, a project of the Mercatus Center’s PERR team (Program for Economic 
    Research on Regulation), is an effort to expand the frontiers of economic and 
    legal research by providing an open-source framework to uncover the latent data 
    in almost any text. QuantGov is able to complete this nearly impossible task by 
    using a machine learning algorithm that consists of a corpus, an estimator, and 
    a project (which can be downloaded in the platform section of this website). 
    A machine learning algorithm teaches a program how to complete a task via training 
    compared to copious amounts of computer code. Not only is QuantGov an open-source 
    code framework, it is also a collection of publically available datasets created 
    through the framework.</p>

  <p>The goal of the QuantGov project is three-fold. First, the project looks to open 
    new lines of research by unlocking the latent data in legal text. Second, through 
    the unlocking of new data, new research will be facilitated and encouraged. Third, 
    to provide a central hub for new research and datasets created via QuantGov, allowing 
    for an even more accelerated creation of new research and ideas.</p>
  
  <p>QuantGov’s website provides the means to complete everything listed above. This website 
    offers the complete framework for QuantGov’s machine learning algorithm under the platform 
    tab. Datasets produced using the QuantGov framework can be found under the data tab. The data 
    tab is also home to the original RegData datasets, which looks to quantify federal regulation 
    by industry over time. Interactive charts and graphs that use data produced by QuantGov and 
    PERR, including the now famous QuantGov Regulatory Clock, can be found under the charts tab. 
    Finally, the research tab includes all of the known original research that uses QuantGov data.</p>
  
  <p>We sincerely hope that you enjoy exploring QuantGov and its cutting edge capabilities. Please do 
    not hesitate to reach out to us with any question regarding QuantGov. If you use QuantGov as a 
    means to create original research and/or data, we would love to hear from you!</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>The Program for Economic Research on Regulation</p>
