  <p>What is QuantGov?</p>
  
  <p>QuantGov is an effort to expand the frontiers of economic and legal 
    research by providing an open-source framework to uncover the latent data in 
    almost any text. QuantGov is able to complete this linguistic, data mining task by 
    using a machine learning algorithm that consists of a corpus, an estimator, 
    and a project (which can be downloaded in the platform section of this website). 
    A machine learning algorithm teaches a program how to complete a task via training, 
    compared to copious amounts of computer code.</p>
  
  <p>History of QuantGov</p>

  <p>QuantGov grew out of the RegData project that was originally released in 2012, 
    and has since been updated an additional three times. RegData looked to improve the 
    measurement of regulations and the regulatory process by quantifying the amount of 
    regulations in a consistent and reliable way. RegData completed this task by using 
    an older version of the same machine learning algorithm that QuantGov currently uses. 
    The progression from RegData to QuantGov reflects two realizations: first, that the 
    kinds of tools used in RegData can be useful in other contexts, and second, that a clear 
    framework could ease adoption of these methods and allow researchers to build off of one 
    another's work without constant reinvention of the wheel.</p>
  
  <p>Future of QuantGov</p>
  
  <p>The future of QuantGov is extremely bright, especially in the policy realm. By 
    open-sourcing the machine learning algorithm that drives both RegData and QuantGov, 
    we hope that private, quantitative research in almost every realm of policy will 
    explode exponentially. QuantGov will also open up new avenues for research from think 
    tanks, government agencies, and university based research centers. All of the above 
    mentioned groups will now have the ability to use QuantGov's platform to expand and 
    add to their research. A second goal for the future of QuantGov is to continue to collect
    the research that QuantGov users produce so that the base of quantitative research will
    continue to grow and that research overlap will be avoided.</p>
