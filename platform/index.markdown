The [QuantGov Architecture](http://docs.quantgov.org/architecture) consists of three types of components:

 * Corpora, which represent a body of text;
 * Estimators, which apply a classification, regression, or unsupervised machine learning algorithm; and
 * Projects, which tie together corpora and estimators to create new datasets.

 This page lists the official QuantGov components. To find a particular
 component, choose the folder for that type and locate the desired component in
 the table. Each component can be downloaded as a zip archive or forked on GitHub.

 For more information about the QuantGov Platform, see the [QuantGov technical documentation](http://docs.quantgov.org).
