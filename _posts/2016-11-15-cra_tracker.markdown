### Tracking Rules Subject to Congressional Review

Congress passed the Congressional Review Act (CRA) in 1996 in order to take greater control over the regulatory process. The CRA allows Congress to prevent any regulation from taking effect by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 legislative days of the rule’s finalization. Because the resolution must be either signed by the president or passed over the president’s veto, the Act is rarely invoked in practice. In fact, the CRA has only ever been successfully used once to overturn a Clinton administration rule, during the early days of the George W. Bush administration.

The results of the 2016 election, however, mean that the president and both houses of Congress will be held by the opposite party of the outgoing president. This means the new Congress could pass resolutions of disapproval to be signed by President Trump. Assuming that the lame duck session of Congress will use 16 legislative days, rules finalized on or after May 27, 2016 will be eligible for congressional disapproval under the CRA.

The chart above live updates the number of significant rules finalized on each day of the CRA-eligible period. A rule is deemed significant if it is likely to have an economic impact of \$100 million or more, interacts adversely with other agency actions, substantially changes entitlement, grant, loan, or user fee programs, or affects the president’s priorities. The searchable table below contains a live list of significant rules that are CRA-eligible. Click on the title of any regulation to go to its page in the *Federal Register*.
