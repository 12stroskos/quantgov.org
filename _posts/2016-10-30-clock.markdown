### How the Reg Clock Works:
This page is updated every day with word and restriction counts from the latest version of the [Electronic Code of Federal Regulations](http://www.ecfr.gov/). The data are obtained using the [ecfr corpus](https://github.com/QuantGov/corpus/tree/ecfr), which is built on the [QuantGov Platform](http://quantgov.org/platform).
