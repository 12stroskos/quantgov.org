### Tracking Midnight Regulations

Under the United States Constitution, the president is elected in November, but does not take office until January. Meanwhile, the outgoing presidentâ€™s administration can still use the regulatory rulemaking progress to enact new regulations. In the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, agencies tend to publish a surge of new rules, either to preempt an anticipated change in policy from a new administration, or simply to take advantage of decreased political pressure. These rules, called "midnight regulations," are sometimes too unpopular to adopt before the election. Others are accompanied by seriously poor assessment of the need for the regulation or the benefits and costs of alternatives.

The chart above shows the number of midnight regulations from the Clinton and Bush administrations, as well as live-updates with the number of midnight regulations from the current midnight period. The searchable table below live-updates with every midnight regulation deemed significant, meaning that it is likely to have an annual economic effect of \$100 million or more, interact adversely with the policies of other agencies, make substantial changes to entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or affect the president's policy priorities. Click on the title of any midnight regulation to be taken to its page at the *Federal Register*.
