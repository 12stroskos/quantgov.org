### How This Chart Works

This chart uses the [Federal Register](http://federalregister.gov) API to search for midnight regulations every time the page is loaded. For this chart, a "Midnight Regulation" is defined as a rule listed under a Regulation ID Number (RIN) for which a proposed rule was published between June 1 of the election year and Inauguration Day, and a final rule was published from the day after Election Day through Inauguration Day.
